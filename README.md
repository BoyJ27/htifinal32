To start a local HTTP server via terminal, navigate to the directory in which the project is located, open the terminal there and type in the following command: "$ python3 -m http.server 9000" or "$ ruby -run -ehttpd . -p9000".
Now a live HTTP server is running on local host on 0.0.0.0 port 9000. Therefore, to open the project in your web browser simply type in: "http://localhost:9000/".
Note that it is possible to change the port you want the server to be running on simply by changing the 9000 in the command with the port you want.

Alternatively, you might download XAMPP, place the source code-folder in "C:/XAMPP/htdocs/, launch the apache server in the control panel and go to http://localhost/XXX in your browser (where XX is the name of the folder you placed the source code in),
